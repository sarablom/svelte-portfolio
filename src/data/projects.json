We've used React with TypeScript on the frontend and NodeJS with Express on the backend. We made the prototype and wireframes in Figma. Our database is MongoDB, but we don't store a lot of data, since we've mainly been working with external API:s. This project includes 6 external API:s! I really learned a lot, and I'm so proud of the end result.",
