        <h3>Why code?</h3>
        <p>I started a one-man company called 'Sara Fox Barnkl√§der'. It was an online shop where I sold
            handmade childens clothing. When I started to create the webb site I was more and more curious to
            learn coding and looked in to educations in Front-end development. I got the tips that a Higher Vocational
            Education is a very good platform to learn coding, I applied and was admitted. I instantly knew this was the right thing for me!
