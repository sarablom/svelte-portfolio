        I'm a fullstack developer, with main focus on frontend. My main
        languages are JavaScript and TypeScript and I've mainly been working
        with React, NodeJS and Express. I have experince with NoSQL and SQL
        databases like MongoDB, Firebase and MySQL. I've done som prototyping
        in both Adobe XD and Figma. I also have great experience with Git and
        GitHub. I've been working in Scrum and Kanban teams for several years,
        so I know a lot about agile team work. If I may say it myself, I'm
        great at keeping a good relationship with both customers and team
        members.

        I previosly worked in the transport sector for 15 years. I started as
        a busdriver, then I managed the bus fleet. After that I worked in the
        trafic controll, to help make sure that all traffic ran smoothly. Then
        I started working for the head of public transport in my region called
        Västtrafik.

        In between my different work positions I've also completed a couple of
        educations. I have a bachelor degree in learship and change
        management. Even though I figured at I didn't want to be a company
        leader, the education made me grow a lot as a person, and I think it
        made me a better employee, with a wider perspective of organizational
        issues.
