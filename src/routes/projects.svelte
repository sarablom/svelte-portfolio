        <h3>Vobbiz</h3>
        <p>
          This is my first real project that is going live in the fall of
          2022. I've been part of a team of three people and we've done the
          project from scratch in three months time. We've used React with
          TypeScript on the frontend and NodeJS with Express on the backend.
          We made the prototype and wireframes in Figma. Our database is
          MongoDB, but we don't store a lot of data, since we've mainly been
          working with external API:s. This project includes 6 external API:s!
          I really learned a lot, and I'm so proud of the end result.

        <h3>Instablam</h3>
        <p>
          An application where you can take photos and save them to a gallery.
          The photos are saved in LocalStorage. The focus with building this
